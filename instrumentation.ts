/**
 * Next.js instrumentation hook.
 *
 * Runs once per server process on startup. Two responsibilities:
 *
 *   1. The generic **app boot seam**: call `initApp()` from `lib/app/bootstrap.ts`
 *      in every environment (production + development, nodejs runtime). Sunrise
 *      ships that file empty; a fork fills it (Daybreak boots its framework tier
 *      there). Core carries no reference to the fork's internals — the seam is a
 *      plain call, so an upstream that has no framework folder still builds.
 *   2. An in-process maintenance ticker in **development only** (below).
 *
 * Why the ticker is dev-only:
 *   - Production deployments run the maintenance tick via an external
 *     cron (see `.context/orchestration/scheduling.md`). The cron is
 *     authoritative and survives serverless cold starts.
 *   - Without this hook, dev developers have to remember to POST the
 *     maintenance tick endpoint manually — queued evaluation runs,
 *     scheduled workflows, retry queues etc. otherwise sit idle and
 *     "didn't progress" looks like a bug.
 *
 * The interval mirrors a typical production cron cadence (60s). The
 * shared `runMaintenanceTick()` body holds its own overlap guard, so
 * a slow tick can't pile up — the next interval call skips with a
 * "previous tick still running" log line.
