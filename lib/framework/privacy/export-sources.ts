/**
 * Framework subject-data manifest (GDPR Art. 15) — the framework tier's half of
 * the subject-access export.
 *
 * Sunrise's `lib/privacy/export-sources.ts` covers the PLATFORM's tables and
 * cannot see Daybreak's; `lib/app/data-export.ts` is the seam it exposes for
 * everything it cannot see. Daybreak fills that seam as a bridge (its third,
 * after `bootstrap.ts` and `admin-nav.ts`), and this file is what the bridge
 * collects — every `framework_*` table holding data about a person, with an
 * explicit disposition:
 *
 * - `export`      — the subject's own data, returned in full.
 * - `attribution` — framework config the subject authored: id + label + date.
 *   The config belongs to the organisation; the fact of authorship belongs to
 *   the subject. This is the same reasoning erasure uses when it retains the
 *   row and nulls the link.
 *
 * **The disposition is not a fresh judgement — it mirrors the erasure policy
 * already written into each migration.** A `userId` column with a hand-written
 * `ON DELETE CASCADE` is personal data (it goes when the subject goes), so it
 * exports in full. A `createdBy` column with `ON DELETE SET NULL` is retained
 * config, so it exports as attribution. Keeping the two halves of GDPR agreeing
 * on what a row *is* is the point; if you change one, change the other.
 *
 * **Adding a framework table?** Add it here too. The guard at
 * `tests/unit/lib/framework/privacy/export-sources.test.ts` parses
 * `prisma/schema/framework-*.prisma` and fails until you do — the framework-tier
 * counterpart of the core guard, and for the same reason: erasure fails loudly
 * (a missing `onDelete` throws `P2003`), while an export that omits a table
 * looks exactly like a complete answer to the person reading it.
 *
 * **Never delete a row here to make that test pass.** That ships a silently
 * short answer to a data subject. Exclude it deliberately, with a reason, via
 * `FRAMEWORK_EXCLUDED_SOURCES`.
 *
 * @see lib/privacy/export-sources.ts · lib/app/data-export.ts
