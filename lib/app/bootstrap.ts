/**
 * App boot bridge — the fork-owned target of core's generic `initApp()` seam.
 *
 * Core's `instrumentation.ts` calls `initApp()` once at server startup (nodejs
 * runtime, production + development). In upstream Sunrise this file is empty by
 * default (the generic seam is fork-first here — to be filed upstream, see the
 * boot-seam follow-up in the f-bootstrap plan); Daybreak fills it to boot the
 * framework tier, then delegates to a reserved leaf hook. This is the ONE
 * `lib/app/*` file Daybreak fills — the single sanctioned core → framework bridge
 * (the ESLint boundary exempts `lib/app/**` for exactly this reason; see
 * f-bootstrap t-2 ↔ t-3).
 *
 * `@/lib/framework` is imported DYNAMICALLY on purpose: a static specifier is
 * resolved at BUILD time, so Sunrise or a sibling fork (no `lib/framework/`
 * folder) would fail `next build`. The reference lives only in this fork-owned
 * file, never in core — which is why `instrumentation.ts` calls this seam rather
 * than importing the framework directly.
